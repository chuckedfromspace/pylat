# Pylat

A collection of `numpy`- and `scipy`-based modules for Laser Absorption Tomography.
Pylat works well with irregular laser configurations and has a built-in example for
inferring temperature and species concentrations based on 2-color laser absorption.

Neural network (such as CNN) based reconstruction methods will be added in the future.

from [Twynstra and Daun (2012)](https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/fulltext.cfm?uri=ao-51-29-7059&id=244091).
